Manually iterating over a container
===================================

This construct is about 10 times faster than the "for ... of" construct, when
using GNAT GPL 2014.

When comparing the -gnatD output of the two versions, the inner loop of the
"for ... of" version contains 98 lines instead of 28 lines.  But why?  Is this
version less safe?
